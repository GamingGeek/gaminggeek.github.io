## Who Am I

Hey, I'm Jake o/ I'm a 17 year old student and Python developer (if you couldn't already tell from the Python snippet above) from Ireland.

## Projects

I've worked on quite a few projects in the past but these are the ones I'm focused on the most...

Name | Description
-----| ----------
Fire (Active) |  A Discord bot for all! With many features such as music, moderation and even Google Assistant, Fire is the only bot you need. [Website](https://fire.gaminggeek.dev/)
YouTube (Active) | My YouTube channel consists of a wide variety of content... Just kidding! It's mostly Minecraft (as that's the only game I play) but I'm starting to upload a bit more coding content too [Check it out](https://youtube.com/GamingGeek)
SpectralMC (Gone but not forgotten) | SpectralMC was my Minecraft server I used to work on hoping it would be the **next big thing** but I never really released it. I just had a "beta" period. It was at this time that I used [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) to "code" plugins

## What's this blog for

My blog will have lots of things. For example...

* Personal updates.
* Updates about projects
* Cool things I've found related to coding

and potentially other things I haven't listed here! The software used to make my website is kinda *made for blogging* so I thought I might aswell start a blog :joy:

```python
def footer():
  print(
  '''
    Welp, that's it for this blog post. 
    I don't really know when the next one will be (most likely when I have nothing to do)
    so I guess I'll see you then! Bye o/
  '''
  )
