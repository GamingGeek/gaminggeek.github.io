title: Fire Updates
---

Hey, it's been a while since I've posted here so I thought I'd let you know about some updates to Fire!

## What's new? (Since September 3rd 2019)

**Temporary Role Mentions**

With Fire, you can now make a role mentionable temporarily. It will wait for you to send a message or for 60 seconds to go by and it will disable the role mention

> $tempmention <role>

**Vanity URLs**

Fire can now make an awesome Vanity URL for your Discord server! It uses my domain, `oh-my-god.wtf` with a custom invite code, e.g. 
https://oh-my-god.wtf/geek or https://oh-my-god.wtf/dot

> $vanityurl <code> (type `disable` as the code to disable it)

__Vanity URLs will be heavily monitored! Any URLs that are deemed not suitable will be removed. Any abuse of Vanity URLs will result in being blacklisted from Fire__

**Warnings**

The latest feature added to Fire's moderation module is warnings, a long awaited feature. You can warn someone for their naughty behaviour, list moderation logs (warns, mutes, kicks, bans etc.), clear all warnings for a user and clear a **single warning** unlike some other bots *cough* Dyno *cough*

> $warn <user> <reason>
> $modlogs <user>
> $clearwarns <user>
> $clearwarn <case id>

## New Logo
