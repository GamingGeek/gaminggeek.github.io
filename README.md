# Inviting Fire

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the `Manage Server` permission in the server you want to invite Fire to.

## **How to Invite?**

Head to [inv.wtf/fire](https://inv.wtf/fire) in your browser. If you aren't signed into Discord on the web, you will be asked to do so. Once signed in, you will be greeted with the page below. Select a server, click Authorize and complete the Captcha. Voila! Fire is now in your server, ready to rock and roll.

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, Fire requests Administrator permissions. This is to ensure no commands break due to a lack of permissions. Don't want to give it all the power? That's fine. You can head to Server Settings &gt; Roles and edit the permissions for the auto-generated "Fire" role.
